## Inspiration
After recognizing the enduring popularity of AI tools like ChatGPT, we felt inspired to contribute our own ideas by generating another proactive approach to learning. As students, we are particularly aware of how much AI technology has improved our lives. We couldn't help but explore the possibility of creating something even better and more efficient than the tools available today. Instead of simply copying and pasting AI-generated text, we aimed to find a way that allows users to actively engage in the learning process. Just as other technologies have inspired us, we hope that blank[space] will become a project looked upon favorably by people from all walks of life.

## Description
When users first open our webpage, they are directed to our home page where they can log in with their Google accounts, enabling them to maintain an account and access previous projects. After logging in, users are directed to a page requesting the title of the paper they want to write, along with a question about the paper's topic. This process helps the AI software understand the context behind the paper, leading to more accurate autocompletion. Upon pressing "Enter," users are directed to the AI auto-completing editor. As users enter text into the textbox, their sentences autocorrect with the assistance of the background context gathered on the previous page. This enhances efficiency and speeds up the coding process.
